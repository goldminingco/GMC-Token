## 📢 **COMMUNITY ANNOUNCEMENT**

Dear GMC community,

We are pleased to announce an **important security improvement** that has been successfully implemented on our GMC token on Solana mainnet.

### 🛡️ **WHAT HAS BEEN IMPROVED**

As part of our ongoing commitment to maximum security and transparency, we have **permanently revoked the mint authority** of the GMC token, ensuring that:

✅ **Guaranteed Fixed Supply:** GMC supply is now **technically fixed** at 100,000,000 tokens  
✅ **Impossibility of Inflation:** No new GMC tokens can be created  
✅ **Total Compliance:** Perfect alignment with our whitepaper  
✅ **Maximum Security:** Elimination of any risk of uncontrolled inflation  

### 🔍 **TOTAL TRANSPARENCY**

- **Token Address:** `AUz16jzWuxSpZ3aKANmpocxWUUG6w5qDd1hiGnoUFMXb`
- **Revocation Transaction:** `4EwzDUHHnY8c3Y7eanNhCkBrWdANDUwLuNdmVYEmTWjGz8wVg227MCBLZhRiHAKE6tBbx4jeHa48qvr2PoztMbkE`
- **Current Status:** Mint Authority = `(not set)` - Permanently disabled

### 🎯 **BENEFITS FOR YOU**

1. **🔒 Maximum Security:** Your investment is protected against inflation
2. **📈 Value Preserved:** Fixed supply increases appreciation potential
3. **🏆 Trust:** Demonstration of our responsibility and transparency
4. **🌟 Leadership:** GMC is now one of the most secure tokens on Solana

### ❓ **FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS**

**Q: What does "mint authority revoked" mean?**  
A: It means it's technically impossible to create new GMC tokens. The 100M supply is now final and immutable.

**Q: Does this affect my existing tokens?**  
A: No! Your tokens remain exactly the same. This change only ensures there will be no inflation.

**Q: Why did you do this?**  
A: To provide maximum security and confidence to the community, ensuring our promises are technically inviolable.

**Q: Can I verify this?**  
A: Yes! Visit [SolScan](https://solscan.io/token/AUz16jzWuxSpZ3aKANmpocxWUUG6w5qDd1hiGnoUFMXb) and see that "Mint Authority" is "(not set)".

### 🚀 **NEXT STEPS**

This security improvement allows us to focus 100% on developing ecosystem features:

- 🏦 Staking system with dynamic APY
- 🔥 Burn-for-Boost functionality
- 🤝 Multi-level affiliate system
- 🏛️ Decentralized governance
